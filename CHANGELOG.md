# Change Log for rocThrust

Full documentation for rocThrust is available at [https://rocthrust.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://rocthrust.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## (Unreleased) rocThrust 2.18.0 for ROCm 5.6
### Fixed 
- `lower_bound`, `upper_bound`, and `binary_search` failed to compile for certain types.
- Fixed issue where `transform_iterator` would not compile with `__device__`-only operators.
### Changed
- Updated `docs` directory structure to match the standard of [rocm-docs-core](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/rocm-docs-core).
- Removed references to and workarounds for deprecated hcc

## rocThrust 2.17.0 for ROCm 5.5
### Added
- Updated to match upstream Thrust 1.17.2
### Fixed
- set_difference and set_intersection no longer hang if the number of items is above `UINT_MAX`. Previously, the unit tests for set_difference and set_intersection failed the `TestSetDifferenceWithBigIndexes`.

## rocThrust 2.16.0 for ROCm 5.3
### Added
- Updated to match upstream Thrust 1.16.0
### Changed
- rocThrust functionality dependent on device malloc works is functional as ROCm 5.2 reneabled device malloc. Device launched `thrust::sort` and `thrust::sort_by_key` are available for use.

## rocThrust 2.15.0 for ROCm 5.2
### Added
- Packages for tests and benchmark executable on all supported OSes using CPack.
### Known issues
- async_copy, partition, and stable_sort_by_key unit tests are failing on HIP on Windows.

## rocThrust 2.14.0 for ROCm 5.1
### Added
- Updated to match upstream Thrust 1.15.0
### Known issues
- async_copy, partition, and stable_sort_by_key unit tests are failing on HIP on Windows.

## rocThrust 2.13.0 for ROCm 5.0
- Updated to match upstream Thrust 1.13.0
- Updated to match upstream Thrust 1.14.0
- Added async scan
### Changed
- Scan algorithms: `inclusive_scan` now uses the input-type as accumulator-type, `exclusive_scan` uses initial-value-type.
    - This particularly changes behaviour of small-size input types with large-size output types (e.g. `short` input, `int` output).
    - And low-res input with high-res output (e.g. `float` input, `double` output)

## rocThrust-2.11.2 for ROCm 4.5.0
### Added
- Initial HIP on Windows support. See README for instructions on how to build and install.
### Changed
- Packaging changed to a development package (called rocthrust-dev for `.deb` packages, and rocthrust-devel for `.rpm` packages). As rocThrust is a header-only library, there is no runtime package. To aid in the transition, the development package sets the "provides" field to provide the package rocthrust, so that existing packages depending on rocthrust can continue to work. This provides feature is introduced as a deprecated feature and will be removed in a future ROCm release.
### Known issues
- async_copy, partition, and stable_sort_by_key unit tests are failing on HIP on Windows.
- Mixed type exclusive scan algorithm still not using the initial value type for results type.

## [rocThrust-2.11.1 for ROCm 4.4.0]
### Added
- gfx1030 support
- Address Sanitizer build option
### Fixed
- async_transform unit test failure fixed.

## [rocThrust-2.11.0 for ROCm 4.3.0]
### Added
- Updated to match upstream Thrust 1.11
- gfx90a support added
- gfx803 support re-enabled

## [rocThrust-2.10.9 for ROCm 4.2.0]
### Added
- Updated to match upstream Thrust 1.10
### Changed
- Minimum cmake version required for building rocThrust is now 3.10.2
### Fixed
- Size zero inputs are now properly handled with newer ROCm builds that no longer allow zero-size kernel grid/block dimensions
- Warning of unused results fixed.

## [rocThrust-2.10.8 for ROCm 4.1.0]
### Added
- No new features

## [rocThrust-2.10.7 for ROCm 4.0.0]
### Added
- Updated to upstream Thrust 1.10.0
- Implemented runtime error for unsupported algorithms and disabled respective tests.
- Updated CMake to use downloaded rocPRIM.

## [rocThrust-2.10.6 for ROCm 3.10]
### Added
- Added copy_if on device test case
### Known issues
- ROCm support for device malloc has been disabled. As a result, rocThrust functionality dependent on device malloc does not work. Please avoid using device launched thrust::sort and thrust::sort_by_key. Host launched functionality is not impacted. A partial enablement of device malloc is possible by setting HIP_ENABLE_DEVICE_MALLOC to 1. Thrust::sort and thrust::sort_by_key may work on certain input sizes but is not recommended for production code.

## [rocThrust-2.10.5 for ROCm 3.9.0]
### Added
- Updated to upstream Thrust 1.9.8
- New test cases for device-side algorithms
### Fixes
- Bugfix for binary search
- Implemented workarounds for hipStreamDefault hang
### Known issues
- ROCm support for device malloc has been disabled. As a result, rocThrust functionality dependent on device malloc does not work. Please avoid using device launched thrust::sort and thrust::sort_by_key. Host launched functionality is not impacted. A partial enablement of device malloc is possible by setting HIP_ENABLE_DEVICE_MALLOC to 1. Thrust::sort and thrust::sort_by_key may work on certain input sizes but is not recommended for production code.

## [rocThrust-2.10.4 for ROCm 3.8.0]
### Added
- No new features
### Known issues
- ROCm support for device malloc has been disabled. As a result, rocThrust functionality dependent on device malloc does not work.

### Added
- Updated to upstream Thrust 1.9.4
### Changed
- Package dependecy change to rocprim only
### Known issues
- ROCm support for device malloc has been disabled. As a result, rocThrust functionality dependent on device malloc does not work. Please avoid using device launched thrust::sort and thrust::sort_by_key. Host launched functionality is not impacted.

## [rocThrust-2.10.1 for ROCm 3.5.0]
### Added
- Improved tests with fixed and random seeds for test data
### Changed
- CMake searches for rocThrust locally first; downloads from github if local search fails
### Deprecated
- HCC build deprecated
