# Changelog for rocThrust

Documentation for rocThrust available at
[https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocThrust/en/latest/](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocThrust/en/latest/).

## (Unreleased) rocThrust 3.2.0 for ROCm 6.3

### Changes

* Enabled the upstream (thrust) test suite for execution by default. It can still be disabled by CMake option `-DENABLE_UPSTREAM_TESTS=OFF`.

### Fixes

* Fixed the HIP backend not passing `TestCopyIfNonTrivial` from the upstream (thrust) test suite. 

## (Unreleased) rocThrust 3.1.0 for ROCm 6.2

### Additions

* Merged changes from upstream CCCL/thrust 2.2.0
  * Updated the contents of `system/hip` and `test` with the upstream changes to `system/cuda` and `testing`

### Changes

* Updated internal calls to `rocprim::detail::invoke_result` to use the public API `rocprim::invoke_result`.
* Use `rocprim::device_adjacent_difference` for `adjacent_difference` API call.
* Updated internal use of custom iterator in `thrust::detail::unique_by_key` to use rocPRIM's `rocprim::unique_by_key`.
* Updated `adjecent_difference` to make use of `rocprim:adjecent_difference` when iterators are comparable and not equal otherwise use `rocprim:adjacent_difference_inplace`.

### Fixes
* Fixed incorrect implementation of `thrust::optional<T&>::emplace()`.

### Known issues
* `thrust::reduce_by_key` outputs are not bit-wise reproducible, as run-to-run results for pseudo-associative reduction operators (e.g. floating-point arithmetic operators) are not deterministic on the same device.
* Note that currently, rocThrust memory allocation is performed in such a way that most algorithmic API functions cannot be called from within hipGraphs.

## rocThrust 3.0.0 for ROCm 6.0

### Additions

* Updated to match upstream Thrust 2.0.1
* NV_IF_TARGET macro from libcu++ for NVIDIA backend and HIP implementation for HIP backend.

### Changes

* The cmake build system now additionally accepts `GPU_TARGETS` in addition to `AMDGPU_TARGETS` for
  setting the targeted gpu architectures. `GPU_TARGETS=all` will compile for all supported architectures.
  `AMDGPU_TARGETS` is only provided for backwards compatibility, `GPU_TARGETS` should be preferred.
* Removed cub symlink from the root of the repository.
* Removed support for deprecated macros (THRUST_DEVICE_BACKEND and THRUST_HOST_BACKEND).

### Fixes
* Fixed a segmentation fault when binary search / upper bound / lower bound / equal range was invoked with `hip_rocprim::execute_on_stream_base` policy.

### Known issues

* The `THRUST_HAS_CUDART` macro, which is no longer used in Thrust (it's provided only for legacy
  support) is replaced with `NV_IF_TARGET` and `THRUST_RDC_ENABLED` in the NVIDIA backend. The
  HIP backend doesn't have a `THRUST_RDC_ENABLED` macro, so some branches in Thrust code may
  be unreachable in the HIP backend.

## rocThrust 2.18.0 for ROCm 5.7

### Fixes
* `lower_bound`, `upper_bound`, and `binary_search` failed to compile for certain types.
* Fixed issue where `transform_iterator` would not compile with `__device__`-only operators.

### Changes
* Updated `docs` directory structure to match the standard of [rocm-docs-core](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/rocm-docs-core).
* Removed references to and workarounds for deprecated hcc


## rocThrust 2.17.0 for ROCm 5.5

### Additions

* Updates to match upstream Thrust 1.17.2

### Changes

* `partition_copy` now uses `rocprim::partition_two_way` for increased performance

### Fixes

* `set_difference` and `set_intersection` no longer hang if the number of items is above `UINT_MAX`
  (the unit tests for `set_difference` and `set_intersection` used to fail the
  `TestSetDifferenceWithBigIndexes`)

## rocThrust 2.16.0 for ROCm 5.3

### Additions

* Updates to match upstream Thrust 1.16.0

### Changes

* rocThrust functionality dependent on device malloc is functional (ROCm 5.2 reenabled device malloc); you can now use device launched `thrust::sort` and `thrust::sort_by_key`

## rocThrust 2.15.0 for ROCm 5.2

### Additions

* Packages for tests and benchmark executables on all supported operating systems using CPack

### Known issues

* `async_copy`, `partition`, and `stable_sort_by_key` unit tests are failing for HIP on Windows

## rocThrust 2.14.0 for ROCm 5.1

### Additions

* Updates to match upstream Thrust 1.15.0

### Known issues

* `async_copy`, `partition`, and `stable_sort_by_key` unit tests are failing for HIP on Windows

## rocThrust 2.13.0 for ROCm 5.0

### Changes

* Updates to match upstream Thrust 1.13.0
* Updates to match upstream Thrust 1.14.0
* Added async scan
* Scan algorithms: `inclusive_scan` now uses the `input-type` as `accumulator-type`; `exclusive_scan`
  uses `initial-value-type`
  * This changes the behavior of small-size input types with large-size output types (e.g. `short` input,
    `int` output) and low-res input with high-res output (e.g. `float` input, `double` output)

## rocThrust-2.11.2 for ROCm 4.5.0

### Additions

* Initial HIP on Windows support

### Changes

* Packaging has changed to a development package (called `rocthrust-dev` for `.deb` packages and
  `rocthrust-devel` for `.rpm` packages). Because rocThrust is a header-only library, there is no runtime package. To aid in the transition, the development package sets the `provides` field to `rocthrust`, so that existing packages that are dependent on rocThrust can continue to work. This `provides` feature is introduced as a deprecated feature because it will be removed in a future ROCm release.

### Known issues

* `async_copy`, `partition`, and `stable_sort_by_key` unit tests are failing for HIP on Windows
* Mixed-type exclusive scan algorithm is not using the initial value type for the results type

### Known issues

* We've disabled ROCm support for device malloc. As a result, rocThrust functionality dependent on
  device malloc does not work--avoid using device launched `thrust::sort` and `thrust::sort_by_key`. Note
  that Host launched functionality is not impacted.
  * A partial enablement of device malloc is possible by setting `HIP_ENABLE_DEVICE_MALLOC` to 1.
  * `thrust::sort` and `thrust::sort_by_key` may work on certain input sizes but we don't recommended
    this for production code.
