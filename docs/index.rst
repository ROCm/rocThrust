Overview
========

rocThrust is a parallel algorithm library. This library has been ported to `HIP <https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP>`_ / `ROCm <https://rocm.docs.amd.com>`_ platform, which uses the `rocPRIM <https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rocPRIM>`_ library. The HIP ported library works on HIP/ROCm platforms. Currently there is no CUDA backend in place.
